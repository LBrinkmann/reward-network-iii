4,6422d978aff8868105633834,AI_lineage,I tried the ways that have the most green patchs,TODO

8,6422d978aff8868105633836,AI_lineage,I was trying to associate the color of the arrows with the points,TODO
9,6422d978aff8868105633836,AI_lineage,I wish there was more time. I tried to check which node was the one connected with more green arrows and arrive there.,TODO

15,6422d978aff886810563383a,AI_lineage,My strategy was trying to reach the nodes that allow you to move while only gaining points. Preferably one with dark green and green point move,TODO
16,6422d978aff886810563383b,AI_lineage,I followed the arrows from the highlighted alphabet to another alphabet that the arrow points to  and all along I followed the same color of the arrows. ,TODO
17,6422d978aff886810563383b,AI_lineage,I followed the colour of the arrow specifically green pointing from one highlighted alphabet to the next.,TODO
