1,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8ac9,AI_lineage,Jump to more green points than red. Try to follow a pattern that opens up another favorable move for the next move to a green point if i must jump to a red line.,TODO

3,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8aca,AI_lineage,Try to reach the two nodes that are connected in a loop in as less moves as possible,TODO

5,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8acb,AI_lineage,"I tried to see the best path, sometimes I was not able to figure out the best way to go to the areas with more green arrows, because I started panicking and was not able to get there. ",TODO
6,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8acc,AI_lineage,I think I tried to take a look at the network and tried to quickly understand which paths I shouldn't take,TODO
7,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8acc,AI_lineage,My strategy was to get the 3 red arrows as early as possible to try and get the green ones that are more valued,TODO
8,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8acd,AI_lineage,didn't have a strategy,TODO
9,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8acd,AI_lineage,i tried to get as much green as possible in this task,TODO
10,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8ace,AI_lineage,I looked at where the arrow was pointing and whether there is another arrow from my next node,TODO
11,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8ace,AI_lineage,Choose the violet as first two or three choices and that will lead you to manier greens,TODO

14,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8ad0,AI_lineage,"I would try and work out a path first, but often ended up panicking and clicking due to the short time limit.",TODO
15,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8ad0,AI_lineage,"Try to maximize green arrows, especially loops. Use the light pink (0) if necessary.",TODO
16,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8ad1,AI_lineage,"I had to think quickly and move on to the next arrow if the one I choose doesn't work but because timers make me nervous, I end up fucking up.",TODO
17,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8ad1,AI_lineage,I used strategies I learnt from the previous examples.,TODO
18,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8ad2,AI_lineage,Focus on the nodes that have green lines and try to find a way to a darker green line.,TODO
19,642bdb6f5b5b9c825f6d8ad2,AI_lineage,Try to find a way to more green lines even if you start with purple lines at first.,TODO
