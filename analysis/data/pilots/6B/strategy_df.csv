0,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd3005827,6,I made sure the network that will give me points are the ones I linked together ,8,0
1,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd3005827,27,I made sure the linked network that gives more point is what I connected together,8,1
2,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd3005828,6,"I picked the letter I preferred when choosing between 2/3 options, very random strategy",9,0
3,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd3005828,27,I tried to mainly go for the darker green ones but occasionally would use a neutral or negative to split and find a green. Usually a go to Green back and forth is useful but sometimes the red help..,9,1
4,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd3005829,6,I looked for a loop of at least 100+ points and accepted that as good enough.,10,0
5,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd3005829,27,"Since I wouldn't get any points, I could show them the full network rather than getting ""the most"".",10,1
6,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd300582a,6,"By keeping exploring to a minimum and keeping a solid focus on how many points I could gain, I simply chose the path with the largest points and repeated those few steps",11,0
7,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd300582a,27,By keeping the losses down to a minimum and finding a path with a constant significant increase ,11,1
8,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd300582b,6,tried to stay close to the green lines.,12,0
9,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd300582b,27,kept clicking on the darkest green letters.,12,1
10,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd300582d,6,I went with the path that provided the most points rather than trying to find an unknown path that was potentially better.,13,0
11,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd300582d,27,"If you follow the -50 points three times, it will lead you to a path where you can go back and forth for 400 points each",13,1
12,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd300582e,6,looked for the most points possible by looking at the colours,14,0
13,655e2a2e7cb69f5cd300582e,27,attempting to follow the highest point colours and look at patterns when multiple arrows shown ,14,1
14,655e2a2f7cb69f5cd3005837,6,stick to green kept a pattern,23,0
15,655e2a2f7cb69f5cd3005837,27,3 red all green      ,23,1
16,655e2a2f7cb69f5cd3005838,6,tried to stay with green routes where possible,24,0
17,655e2a2f7cb69f5cd3005838,27,no idea i just tried to stay green,24,1
18,655e2a2f7cb69f5cd300583a,6,I followed the green or neutral arrows.,25,0
19,655e2a2f7cb69f5cd300583a,27,Choosing three negative arrows at the start seems to unlock high value postive arrows,25,1
