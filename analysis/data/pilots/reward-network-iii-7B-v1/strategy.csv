656628b4668ebdf5919e97a7,6,It's quite hard to understand the concept of it!  I just keep looking for the green lines or the lesser purple lines to minimise losses,10,0
656628b4668ebdf5919e97a7,22,The example moves so fast its nearly impossible to memorise what the other player did! I just try to look for the green or neutral arrows and follow them,10,1
