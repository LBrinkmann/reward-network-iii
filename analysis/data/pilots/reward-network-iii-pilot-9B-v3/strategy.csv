65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00be,6,0,repeating closed (circular) network connections with positive points and choosing the way to the most connected points
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00be,22,1,repeating the positive loops as many times as possible while starting from a negative point direction
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00bf,6,0,"at first, I tried to just go for green arrows but quickly realized this would not allow me to solve the circle. I need to strategically lose points to ensure I finish the network"
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00bf,22,1,Taking loses early on allows you to reveal the winning combinations
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c0,6,0,Avoid pink and go for green.
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c0,22,1,Try to locate the darker green routes.
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c1,6,0,the best strategy is to keep practising
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c1,22,1,always go for gains.think of a positive network
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c2,6,0,clicking the choice that gave the most points
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c2,22,1,sometimes starting on a loss meant bigger gains 
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c3,6,0,Follow networks that are more green colored for more points
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c3,22,1,repeating and going back and forwards on the same networks that were green
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c4,6,0,Continuously using a known path that only produces positive points as there is little time therefore trying to figure out the the network with the most points is not efficient.
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c4,22,1,Following the path with the least points eventually leads to a continuous network where you can follow a path with the most points.
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c5,6,0,checking the colour for each move to maximise points and avoid the lines with negative out comes
65bb905ffa589ac7c2fb00c5,22,1,Choosing the path with points or neutral outcomes and avoiding the path with negative outcomes
65bb9061fa589ac7c2fb00d1,6,0,I would try and go for the steps that were green and avoid the pink and red. 
65bb9061fa589ac7c2fb00d1,22,1,You have to do the first three moves to lose points to get in a good place where you can just make moves to get the full points
65bb9062fa589ac7c2fb00d5,6,0,"I aimed to go for green as much as possible, the darker the better, and avoid the pinks"
65bb9062fa589ac7c2fb00d5,22,1,Trying to get two dark green arrows that you can just keep jumping between 
65bb9887fa589ac7c2fb00e0,6,0,repeating closed (circular) network connections with positive points and choosing the way to the most connected points
65bb9887fa589ac7c2fb00e0,22,1,repeating the positive loops as many times as possible while starting from a negative point direction
