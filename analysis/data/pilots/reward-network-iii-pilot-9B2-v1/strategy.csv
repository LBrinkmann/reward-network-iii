65bbd8cefa589ac7c2fb00ea,6,0,"GOing around in a circle that is all positive points, not necessarily going for a new path"
65bbd8cefa589ac7c2fb00ea,22,1,Choosing new paths until you find the most lucrative ones and then cycling between them
65bbd8cefa589ac7c2fb00eb,6,0,I don't feel I was very successful at this task. I noticed focussing on the highest point option I could choose but I think it is more successful not to repeat nodes already visited
65bbd8cefa589ac7c2fb00eb,22,1,Finding a loop of highly positive connections with the least possible connections needed to start the loop.
65bbd8cefa589ac7c2fb00ed,6,0,always go for the lightest colour pink or any green (dark green the most) to avoid major loss
65bbd8cefa589ac7c2fb00ed,22,1,getting 3 losses to find a string of dark greens seems to work best
65bbd8cffa589ac7c2fb00ee,6,0,"To be honest, I am not completely sure as 30 seconds is too little time to figure out realistically in my case what is worth the trouble, network links wise..."
65bbd8cffa589ac7c2fb00ee,22,1,"Apparently it was selecting very specific points on the network and taking a loss to make double the win...Only my opinion as I don't get what the whole point of this is so far but continuing to play,"
65bbd8cffa589ac7c2fb00ef,6,0,losing point could help sometimes
65bbd8cffa589ac7c2fb00ef,22,1,just take the highest score
65bbd8cffa589ac7c2fb00f0,6,0,"Avoid dark pink, if there is no green try and go for the neutral"
65bbd8cffa589ac7c2fb00f0,22,1,II observe that if you start with the negative amounts eventually only gren amountse show 
65bbd8cffa589ac7c2fb00f1,6,0,"Just following the greenest coloured lines and if not available, then lightest pink ones."
65bbd8cffa589ac7c2fb00f1,22,1,To get onto the dark greens as quickly as possible
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00fa,6,0,Pressing all the circles that were green
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00fa,22,1,Choosing a neutral colour then choosing a green one
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00fb,6,0,the colour options were helpful
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00fb,22,1,the colour scheme is helpful
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00fc,6,0,Finding a move that scores 200 points and redoing it.
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00fc,22,1,Repeating patterns of moves that score high points.
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00fe,6,0,"just pick the one that reduces the least points, if you find two nodes that give positive points and go back and forth keep going between those two"
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00fe,22,1,find a path that cycles and gives maximum points on each path
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00ff,6,0,Following the green buttons.
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb00ff,22,1,It was successful to firts loose and then gain.
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb0100,6,0,working out what the higher colours were so as to gain as many points
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb0100,22,1,darker green is always better
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb0101,6,0,I have to determine the right direction of the arrow to score as many points as possible
65bbd8d1fa589ac7c2fb0101,22,1,I need to perform movements quickly and as accurately as possible to achieve as much as possible
65bbd8d3fa589ac7c2fb010b,6,0,I'm not sure I've worked out a strategy yet...
65bbd8d3fa589ac7c2fb010b,22,1,Repeating the same pattern 
65bbd8d3fa589ac7c2fb010c,6,0,"Avoiding revisting a circle OR, if that is unavoidable, exiting through a different route."
65bbd8d3fa589ac7c2fb010c,22,1,Look for the arrow each time that results in the highest gain or the lowest loss.
65bbd8d3fa589ac7c2fb010e,6,0,"Well, I focussed on 1) possible moves, 2) colours, working backwards from the colours with the highest points, to the colours with the lowest points. I did not spot the most successful pattern yet."
65bbd8d3fa589ac7c2fb010e,22,1,"I tried to copy my chosen player's exact strategy to the best of my ability, and I noticed that it was successful."
65bbd8d3fa589ac7c2fb010f,6,0,shorter jumps work higher with points
65bbd8d3fa589ac7c2fb010f,22,1,choosing the biggest losses for 3 turns then clicking on the highest points availible
65bbd8d4fa589ac7c2fb0111,6,0,going round in a circle
65bbd8d4fa589ac7c2fb0111,22,1,dont know really cant seem to catch the pattern
65bbe106fa589ac7c2fb0127,6,0,trying to see what gives rewards
65bbe106fa589ac7c2fb0127,22,1,follow the green ones
65bbe10bfa589ac7c2fb0128,6,0,trying to see what gives rewards
65bbe10bfa589ac7c2fb0128,22,1,follow the green ones
65bbe24afa589ac7c2fb012a,6,0,I have to determine the right direction of the arrow to score as many points as possible
65bbe24afa589ac7c2fb012a,22,1,I need to perform movements quickly and as accurately as possible to achieve as much as possible
