65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb001e,6,0,Following green arrows
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb001e,12,1,Following the green arrows
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb001f,6,0,Longer lines were more successful 
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb001f,12,1,Green lines were more points 
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb0020,6,0,Look at the green lines and try and plan a route using only the green lines as much as possible.
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb0020,12,1,Try to follow the green lines and look at planning route back to area where the possibility of more green lines exist. 
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb0021,6,0,Follow the darker green lines wherever possible and avoid the red ones.
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb0021,12,1,Avoid the pink ones wherever possible.
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb0022,6,0,i wasnt really able to observe anything. apart from picking the option that was more towards the green end of the spectrum to get more points
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb0022,12,1,that you may have to lose some points in order to beat the network
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb0023,6,0,Positive moves trying to avoid dark red circles.
65ba9808fa589ac7c2fb0023,12,1,moving to the darkest green first the lighter green
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0024,6,0,Follow the green arrows.
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0024,12,1,Follow the green arrows.
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0025,6,0,green was more points lilac was neutral and purple deducted points
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0025,12,1,"the darker the green, more points, lilac didnt gain any and purple deducted points
"
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0026,6,0,always aiming for the green nodes or if none available hopefully a pink one that does not decrease
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0026,22,2,Usually copying the stragey of the previous player will work but it cana be difficult to remember 
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0027,6,0,Not to back track on yourself. 
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0027,22,2,Repeating yourself over letters with gains. 
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0028,6,0,just looking for green arrows
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0028,22,2,following which ever green line is darkest
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0029,6,0,Go through as many nodes as possible to find the paths and then try to find a loop that lead to positive gains
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb0029,22,2,Finding loops that gave positive gains
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb002a,6,0,"Follow green arrows over the pink ones, stick to a repeat of back and forth"
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb002a,22,2,Stick to green and a loop of back and forth between nodes
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb002b,6,0,"I did wonder if going for opposite sides notwithstanding would work, as opposed to just going for the highest payment each time.  It's unclear to me what would be more successful a strategy."
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb002b,22,2,Kind of think I need to find 2 points in the network which have green high paying lines between them then repeat.  Not to focus on getting to all points.
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb002c,6,0,First check which path give more points or lesser penalty points. Otherwise just pick any of the path.
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb002c,22,2,Its the same strategy. Pick the one that give points and leave the one that deduct points albeit I wont be able to connect all the network
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb002d,6,0,"Sometimes there was a loop, which I could see would earn me points overall.  It might not have been the best decision, but it's less risky and guarantees points."
65ba9809fa589ac7c2fb002d,22,2,"Again, I think identifying higher point loops."
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb002e,6,0,Trying to get to different circles even if it reduces points slightly.
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb002e,12,1,Going back and forth between circles for simplicity to gain as many points as possible.
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb002f,6,0,follow the lines that bring most points
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb002f,12,1,memorize colours and follow that
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0030,6,0,I tried to move via positive or neutral pathways
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0030,12,1,Avoiding negative pathways and repeating moves
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0031,6,0,"Each node always links to the same nodes, and so returning to the nodes with green arrows is good"
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0031,12,1,"Once a profitable route is found, repeat it"
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0032,6,0,Avoid the negative points unless there is no other option
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0032,12,1,"Backtracking to a previous position to avoid a new position on a minus point is a good option, sometimes you can repeat the same steps in a cycle to avoid any negative points at all"
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0033,6,0,Going for the darker green arrows
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0033,12,1,Finding a loop of green arrows
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0034,6,0,When I go with the green arrow I gain points
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0034,12,1,When I follow the green lines I gain more points
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0035,6,0,"Following the green lines as much as possible, and the darker = more points"
65ba980bfa589ac7c2fb0035,12,1,"Always following the green where possible, darker = more points"
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb0036,6,0,Try to only pick the higher scoring lines
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb0036,22,2,"If there is a green line then allows follow that, over any other colour"
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb0037,6,0,"I was not taking risks of losing points, but I was rather making less but safe points. I do not know if that was successful though"
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb0037,22,2,"Most of the time, repeating the last player's moves seemed a good strategy"
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb0038,6,0,"I'm not sure I understand the task! Um, remember that pink is low points and green is high so you save time by not having to check it??"
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb0038,22,2,To copy whatever player 3 did!
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb0039,6,0,following the green lines 
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb0039,22,2,following the dark green circle
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb003a,6,0,To keep going back and forth from the letters i knew would provide me with points
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb003a,22,2,to go for the letters that had the highest point output
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb003b,6,0,Click green and the lowest lost point purple
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb003b,22,2,"try to press big minus once ,hoping for more green arrows later"
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb003c,6,0,choosing the route with the most points. 
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb003c,22,2,choosing the option with the most points. 
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb003d,6,0,clicking on the nodes that are highlighted green
65ba980cfa589ac7c2fb003d,22,2,i didnt see much of a pattern
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb003e,6,0,"10 moves isn't a lot (you can't make much use of any info you get) so it seems OK just to make higher-scoring moves early and not click negative ones, even if that means you see less of the network."
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb003e,12,1,"Finding a 'loop' of only positive scores seems good. There is always the possibility I am missing a better 'loop' in unexplored nodes, but hard to test that in just 10 moves."
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb003f,6,0,I just tried to follow green lines
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb003f,12,1,Trying to follow only green lines
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0040,6,0,Following the highest point lines
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0040,12,1,follow all the green lines and repeat.
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0041,6,0,I clicked on the arrow with the colour that gave the most points. 
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0041,12,1,i clicked on the arrow with the colour representing the highest number of points
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0042,6,0,to follow green arrow
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0042,12,1,i just follow green line
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0043,6,0,"To be honest I'm still getting used to it, but I was keeping an eye on the green lines, especially the darker ones and possible moves."
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0043,12,1,"Following the green lines mainly, but also being willing to take risks and lose points by clicking on some of the other colour to open up higher scoring paths"
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0044,6,0,"I got  fare amount of points for my route, and replicated it"
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0044,12,1,"same as first time, try to get around 1500 - repeat route"
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0045,6,0,"If I can find a loop that stays with just green nodes, this might be a good strategy."
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0045,12,1,It might be beneficial to go to a node that isn't immediately the best to then try to find a high scoring 400 pt node.
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0046,6,0,The darker the green the more points I gain.
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0046,22,2,Sometimes losing points opens paths to allow you to gain bigger points.
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0047,6,0,Getting into a loop with only positive points
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0047,22,2,"Maximising the 200 and 400 points, and getting into a positive loop if possible"
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0048,6,0,Go with the green letters.
65ba980efa589ac7c2fb0048,22,2,Try and copy the other players route
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb0049,6,0,to minimise the negetetive points as much as possible
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb0049,22,2,to minimise going to negative points
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb004a,6,0,Taking a loss to move to a position that may open up more options.
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb004a,22,2,Following a clear path initially creates a successful route.
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb004b,6,0,Try and get through as many nodes as possible and hit the ones with the most points.
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb004b,22,2,aim for the green or neutral nodes
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb004c,6,0,I tried to go for the most points
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb004c,22,2,went for greens and i did not really have a strategy.
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb004d,6,0,"Avoiding the darker purple routes 
"
65ba980ffa589ac7c2fb004d,22,2,"Similar to my original thoughts, trying to avoid pain worked better than trying to score highly in each scenario"
65ba9811fa589ac7c2fb004e,6,0,quickly identify which tones of colour give the highest score
65ba9811fa589ac7c2fb004e,12,1,quickly identifying a loop so you already know where to go
65ba9811fa589ac7c2fb0051,6,0,the game seems simple but a bit tricky. it is also very fun and challenging as a game should be
65ba9811fa589ac7c2fb0051,12,1,"wow I think the game is now very simple, interesting and not as much challenging as I thought"
65ba9811fa589ac7c2fb0053,6,0,I found it quite hard to work it out as it was unclear if i had to use all the letters to make the 10 moves and maximise points. knowing what i do now I would try to not duplicate letters
65ba9811fa589ac7c2fb0053,12,1,Follow the dark green or light green arrows and if you have not got those options follow neutral lines
65bb6f09fa589ac7c2fb0085,6,0,Picking the path that gave me the most number of points.
65bb6f09fa589ac7c2fb0085,12,1,Pick the path to the next node that gives the most number of points. Aim for a closed/circular route comprising 200-plus-point paths only.
65bb81d4fa589ac7c2fb0093,6,0,Go with the green letters.
65bb81d4fa589ac7c2fb0093,22,2,Try and copy the other players route
