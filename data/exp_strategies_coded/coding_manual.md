**Rules for Coding Written Strategies**

**Item question:** Please think about a strategy for the network task that maximizes points. What did you observe as successful?

### Rules

- We are only coding for the presence (0/1) of the optimal “loss strategy.” The written statement needs to show that the participant explicitly recognized the strategy.
- The necessary parts for describing the strategy are:
  - **i)** a mention of seeking out losses (“red arrows,” “negative points,” etc.);
  - **ii)** a temporal dimension, i.e., the losses need to be early on & limited (“first,” “3 losses,” “take losses and then…” etc.);
- If participants mention more details, that helps us but is not necessary. For example:
  - They do not have to mention specifically three losses or that there will be some sort of green loop later (in fact, many participants mention loops but do not find the optimal one).
  - They also do not have to actually recommend using it, just recognize it (e.g., “sometimes,” “it might be good to take losses”); but if they are just pitching different ideas, we choose “0.”
- We stick to the statements only and do not refer to other information from the participants. For example:
  - Participants that state “I did what my teacher showed me” are an easy “0.”
- If there is doubt, we are conservative and code “0.”

### Examples

- “I was following the dark green arrows to maximize points.” → 0  
- “Pick the low-scoring letters.” → 0  
- “You have to lose 150 points before getting a high score.” → 1  
- “Sometimes it’s good to take a hit early.” → 1  
- “Try to press big minus and hope for green arrows.” → 1
