                You will be working on a task where your goal is navigate through a series of networks like the one
                depicted on the right. Depending on the moves you choose, you can earn more or less points. These points
                will be converted into bonus payments, so your decisions in the main task will have real financial
                consequences for you.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" align='justify' paragraph>
                <span style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
                    Importantly, there is an ideal pattern of moves that earns the maximum number of points for all
                    networks.
                </span> Figuring out that ideal pattern of moves will help you maximise your bonus payment
                during the
                main task.

                To prepare you for the main task, we will now explain the network in more detail and let you practice
                some examples.
