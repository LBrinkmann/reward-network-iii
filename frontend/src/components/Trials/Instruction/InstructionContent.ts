    welcome: "Welcome to the experiment! We will start with one practice round to explain the task. In this example, you will not earn points towards your bonus payment.",
    individual_start: "Well done! Now the actual experiment with more complex networks begins. The next two rounds are for you to familiarize yourself with these networks: your performance here will not count towards your bonus payment, but try to maximize the number of points in each round!",
    written_strategy_start: "Please think about how you approached the task and write down the strategy you used in trying to maximize points.",
    learning_selection: "Before you play on your own again, you have the opportunity to learn from the solutions submitted by up to two previous players. At the end of the experiment, you will also submit your own solutions, so that future players can learn from them.",
    learning: "You will now see solutions of the selected player for two different networks.\n" +
        "For each network, you will first try to solve the network yourself: the selected player's score in this network will also be provided and when you finish the task there will be a visual comparison of your solution and the player's solution. Next, you will see a full replay of the previous player's solution, and finally you will be able to try the network again by yourself.\n" +
        "Note that you cannot collect points in these rounds, they are for learning only.\n",
    individual: "From now on you are on your own again. Try to maximize your points in the next 4 rounds: half of your bonus will depend on your performance during these rounds!",
    demonstration: "Well done! Now you will play two final rounds that serve as demonstrations for future players to learn from. You will not earn points directly, but the second half of your bonus payment depends on the performance of people that learn from you, so try your best!",
    written_strategy: "Please write down your strategy in solving the task.",
    consent_decline: "You have declined to participate in the experiment. Thank you for your time. Please return the study on Prolific.",
